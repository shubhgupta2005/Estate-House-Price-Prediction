# Estate-House-Price-Prediction
This Repo is about the First ML project made by me Where i have used basic concepts of Machine Learnin and trained the model on the data available on kaggle.com

The data is available on https://www.kaggle.com/ from here i have picked the data which was in csv format and then loaded the data to my jupyter notebook 
The next step which is very important in data analysis is cleaning of data as there could e many empty spaces in the data so we have removed the rows which contains null values
Then we have applied feature engineering (Feature engineering is a data science technique that involves transforming raw data into a machine-readable format to improve the performance of machine learning (ML) models)
Then outier detection data splitting training and prediction 
Need to describe more which i will update later
